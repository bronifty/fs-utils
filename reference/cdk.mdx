# CDK

## Commands

Since I don't globally install anything (unless it's necessary), I'll prefix each of these calls with `npx` or `pnpm dlx`.

:::tip
`pnpm dlx cdk` means download and execute the `cdk` package.

```sh
cdk init app --language typescript
cdk bootstrap
cdk synth
cdk diff
cdk deploy --require-approval never
cdk destroy
```
